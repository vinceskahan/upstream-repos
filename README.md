## tgz files of (sometimes slightly modified) upstream repos

These are tgz balls of the git repos for a number of weewx-related items saved here for safekeeping. Some show up as repos I previously re-stashed on github and/or forked and modified slightly.  In those cases I tried to indicate the changes I made as well as the upstream version it was based on.

Credits of course go to the upstream author.

To use, 'tar zxvf' the .tgz files into a scratch directory to get the full git repo as of the time I downloaded and tarred up the git repos.
